## Project Summary

This mini project focuses on the creation of a responsive blog application. The main goal is to understand the intricacies of creating web applications that can adapt to different screen sizes. I got the inspiration to work on the project from a responsive web design course from Scrimba. The task was to follow a web design and make it responsive. However, me being someone that likes taking up challenges, I decided instead of hard coding the data on the pages. I choose to use JavaScript to dynamically display the data on the UI.  I also added a new feature to enable uses get newsletter in their email address weekly. I did this implementation in a unique way. Rather than creating a new page or adding the form to the bottom of the home page. I chose to create a card for the form and also display a mini window on the screen while blurring the remaining contents of the page. The form has the validation to ensure a valid email in terms of seamtics is entered
